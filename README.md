Steps:
created a database named shop

Created a table sales with fields: salesperson, region, amount.

Inserted 6 rows of sample sales data.

Queried total sales using SUM() grouped by salesperson.

Counted entries using COUNT() grouped by region.

Calculated average sales using AVG() grouped by salesperson.

Filtered using HAVING to show salespersons with total sales over 8500.

These queries helped in drawing insights from raw data by summarizing it meaningfully.
